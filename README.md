An all-in-one app to help roommates manage their expenses, tasks, & shared living space. Could encompass everything from splitting rent to whose groceries are whose in the fridge. Could even be fun to have roommate profiles & link up with other apartments. Expected to be useful for new graduates living in an apartment of their own for the first time, especially if living with new or unfamiliar roommates, or for students currently living off campus due to the pandemic.
